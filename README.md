# Country Info Cards

This app gets information from the countries of the world, with the actual weather from its capital city.
This information is obtained from 2 public APIs:

- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/): This API contains information from countries from all over the world.
- [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/): This Api provides weather forecast from all over the world.

## Design

My first computer ever was a 386 with Window 95 OS. This project is based on the Windows 95 style. When I saw the [Windows 95](<https://www.figma.com/file/m2quavvRgb9W2Q1uCkMYFE/Windows-95-Design-System-(Community)?node-id=70%3A17>) and [Nyan](<https://www.figma.com/file/O5u5mZvYD1fyZeyDYGypFo/Nyan-Design-System-(Community)?node-id=3074%3A20357>) Design Systems I fell in love with them and I wanted to implement them on my project.

At that time, responsive design didn't exist, but today there is not excuse to not do it, so my project can be seen on mobile and tablet devices.

The live demo is [here.](https://elisamunoz.github.io/country-info-cards/)
